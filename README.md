# Robot Arm Joint 3D Printing Task

## üìù Project Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation for 3D printing a robotic arm joint as part of the Smart Methods training task. The main goal is to:
- Convert the robotic arm joint design to **STL format**.
- Slice the model using **AnkerMake Studio**.
- Select the best material for printing and explain why.
- Upload all details and files to this GitHub repository.

## ‚úÖ Steps Performed
1. **Convert to STL**
   - The robotic arm joint design was exported from the CAD software (SolidWorks) to `.stl` format for 3D printing.

2. **Open in AnkerMake Studio**
   - The STL file was opened in **AnkerMake Studio** (based on PrusaSlicer).
   - Selected the printer: **AnkerMake M5 with 0.4mm nozzle**.
   - Selected filament: **AnkerMake PLA+ Basic (White)**.
   - Process Mode: **Precision** for best dimensional accuracy and high-quality finish.

3. **Screenshot**
   - Captured a screenshot showing the selected print settings in AnkerMake Studio.
   - File included: `Arm_Joint_Print_Settings.png`.

4. **Material Selection**
   - **Chosen Material:** PLA+
   - **Why PLA+?**
     - Easy to print, minimal warping.
     - Strong enough for functional parts.
     - Stable dimensional accuracy.
     - Does not require a heated chamber like ABS.
